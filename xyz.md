Creating a solid proposal template for an independent study in a computer science or robotics classroom is crucial to guide students in presenting a well-structured and comprehensive proposal. Below is a suggested template you can use:

### Independent Study Proposal Template

#### Title:
*(Descriptive and engaging title of your project)*

#### Student Name:
*(Your full name)*

#### Grade Level:

#### Proposed Start Date:

#### Proposed End Date:

#### Objective:
*(Briefly describe the main objective of your independent study. What problem or question are you addressing?)*

#### Research Questions:
*(List the specific research questions you plan to investigate during the study. Make them clear, concise, and focused.)*

#### Methodology:
*(Explain the methods and approaches you intend to use to achieve your objectives and answer your research questions. This could include coding, experiments, data analysis, simulations, etc.)*

#### Project Scope:
*(Clearly outline the scope of your project. Define the specific components, technologies, or aspects you plan to focus on.)*

#### Expected Outcomes:
*(Describe the expected outcomes or results of your study. What do you hope to achieve through this independent study?)*

#### Resources Needed:
*(List any materials, software, hardware, or other resources you'll need to complete this study. Include any specific tools or technologies.)*

#### Timeline:
*(Create a detailed timeline outlining the major milestones and activities for your study. Be realistic and allocate time for research, development, testing, and any iterations.)*

| Milestone        | Start Date       | End Date         |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Research         |                  |                  |
| Proposal Finalization |                |                  |
| Development      |                  |                  |
| Testing          |                  |                  |
| Final Report     |                  |                  |

#### Evaluation Criteria:
*(List the criteria that will be used to evaluate your project's success. This could include functionality, creativity, adherence to the timeline, etc.)*

#### Conclusion:
*(Summarize the proposal and reiterate its importance. Highlight the potential impact of the study and what you hope to contribute.)*

#### Mentor Approval:
*(Leave space for your mentor or teacher overseeing the independent study to sign and provide comments.)*

#### Student Signature:
*(Your signature to acknowledge your commitment to the proposed study.)*
